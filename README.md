##### Description

Alarming is a social alarm clock to help everyone organise events and meetups. The App was one of the final projects at Makers Academy. Alarming provides a way for event origanisers to set alarms on attendees phones. For attendees to respond to give there current status(attending or not) and also to post what time they will be arriving. It is also intergrated with google maps to show the location of the event and also get directions to the event from their current location.
